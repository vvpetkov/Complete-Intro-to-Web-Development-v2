# Complete Intro to Web Development v2
## 12 hours Course by Brian Holt host: Frontend Masters
# New repetition for my very old basic web development skills

Complete Intro to Web Development, v2 : More than an introduction, in this course you’ll go from building your first website to having the foundation for becoming a professional web developer with modern skills! By coding along in this course, you'll get experience writing HTML, the primary language for putting content on a page. CSS, a language designed to make your websites look tidy and aesthetically pleasing. And learn how to program, starting with a wonderful language to learn with, JavaScript. After this whirlwind tour of web development, you'll know how to write code with HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript. You'll learn to use your terminal to save your code with Git and as a small bonus primer, you'll get a taste of how to use JavaScript via Node.js to serve your website from a server!

# Ideas / Notes / Abstractions

​    

### HTML 

### CSS 

* Only style in classes!

* If you want to style for everting in the document to look the same :  then use a tag style (all my links look the same)

* Avoid cascading ,more simple ,less problems 

* Specificity (more specific win / no space between )  [StarWars](https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/css_specificity_wars.html)

* Classes is more specific than tags 

* Do Not use ID to style overwrite Classes (bad idea)

* Do Not use !important overwrite ID's (bad idea)

* Do not use **float** we have now **flex**

* The Box Model / display / flex

  * grid 
  * [Is it safe to use CSS grids for my layout?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/CSS_Grid_and_Progressive_Enhancement)
  
* Height,Width,Padding,Border and Margin

  * Height = 200 / Is everting will be 200? / well  it depends :)
   * For all site all box sizing will be predictable after this 
     ```css
      * {
        box-sizing: border-box;
      }
     ```
   * Use only for this problem 'wild card selector' for every site 
   * Wild card selector is a bad idea

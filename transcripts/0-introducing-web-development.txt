>> Brian Holt: Awesome, I'm really, really, really excited to be here with all of you. For people attending online, and people that are watching it later, and for people here in the audience. First of all let's go ahead and get everyone to go to this link right here bit.ly/intro-web-dev. It is important that everything is lowercase, so make sure you do that.

[00:00:24]
This is just gonna take you to, I'm gonna leave that up for a second, but it's gonna take you to the website that you can see up behind it.
>> Brian Holt: So while I'm doing that, while I'm letting you type that in and get to the website, just as kind of a sign, I'm really excited that this is a free workshop and this is something that we are extending to people so that they can learn web development.

[00:00:50]
And I'm really grateful for Frontend Masters for sponsoring that. If I have any wish for you for how much effort I have put into this, for how much effort Frontend Masters have put into this, it's for you to do something nice for someone else. That's just kind of my request for you is that we've done something really nice for you also for you to go find someone that needs something and do something for them.

[00:01:15]
Okay, so that should take you to this website, Intro To Web Dev V2, with all these nice shades of blue that I did not choose. But it looks nice, doesn't it? [LAUGH] So you can see here just to kind of get the lay of the land. This is a website here it's on GitHub, so that means all this is open source.

[00:01:37]
All of these materials will be open source free and forever. So you can take this home afterwards, you can share this website with anyone that wants it. These are literally my notes. That's why I have two laptops up here is cuz I have actually right now it's open on both computers at once.

[00:01:54]
Just in case, I don't know, it's like a safety blanket, I don't know. [LAUGH] So I can type in this one, I can read my notes off this one. So anyway if you fall behind, check the website cuz, again, that's exactly what I'm reading from. Please share this around, that's what this is here for.

[00:02:12]
If you see mistakes or grammar mistakes, I'm sure there are many, many, many of those. Please make a pull request on GitHub, and we will show you how to do that later today, how to make pull requests. So, yeah.
